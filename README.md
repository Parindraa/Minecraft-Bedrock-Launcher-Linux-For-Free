Credits to TheSonicMaster for the modified launcher appimage, and the minecraft version.
So if you want to get Minecraft Bedrock for free on Linux. You have to download the 2 files in the releases, one for the app image and one for the mineraft version.
 Make sure you save the files to Downloads.

Arch Linux
	
	sudo pacman -S git

	cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/FemBoysAreCute/Minecraft-Linux-Bedrock-Launcher-For-Linux-Free.git

	cd Minecraft-Bedrock-Launcher-Linux-For-Free 

	chmod +x archinstall.sh && ./archinstall.sh

Press next and then click integrate and run.

You are not done yet, you have to sign in to your google account and then close the launcher. Open up the terminal and enter the following command.

	cp ~/Downloads/1.16.221-x86_64.zip ~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/

Then start the minecraft launcher and then click the pen button on the bottom left of the screen
And then select the minecraft versions, click x86 Installed. Then you can run the game.
(Seems like there is a problem at the login screen, I don't see mcpelauncher-webview in .local/share. Maybe it's just a arch linux bug)

(IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT DOWNLOAD FOLDER YOU CAN CHANGE IT)

Debian or Ubuntu

	sudo apt-get install git -y && cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/Parindraa/Minecraft-Bedrock-Launcher-Linux-For-Free.git && cd Minecraft-Bedrock-Launcher-Linux-For-Free && cp ~/Downloads/Minecraft.AppImage ~/Minecraft-Bedrock-Launcher-Linux-For-Free/ && chmod +x debinstall.sh && ./debinstall.sh

You are not done yet, you have to sign in to your google account and then close the launcher. Open up the terminal and enter the following command.

        cp ~/Downloads/1.16.221-x86_64.zip ~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/

Press next and then click integrate and run.

Then start the minecraft launcher and then click the pen button on the bottom left of the screen
And then select the minecraft versions, click x86 Installed. Then you can run the game.

If there is any bugs report one to me. I'll fix it.

Literally made on a chromebook running Manjaro Gnome.
